In this project, I conducted an A/B test to compare the performance of two advertising platforms — Facebook Ads and Google Ads (AdWords) — to determine which platform delivered better conversion efficiency and cost performance.

The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and actually validate, through comparison, which platform was more effective in terms of ROI and acquisition cost.

The goal was to move beyond simple reporting and actually validate, through comparison, which platform was more effective in terms of ROI and acquisition cost.

The A/B test focused on:

Conversion Rate
CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
CTR (Click-Through Rate)
CPC (Cost Per Click)
Spend & Conversions
Special care was taken to ensure metric consistency across both platforms so the comparison was fair.


Facebook campaigns delivered higher overall conversion efficiency compared to Google Ads.
CPA showed a noticeable difference, with Facebook achieving approximately 18% lower CPA than Google Ads.
Conversion rates were stronger on Facebook, indicating better audience alignment.
While Google Ads generated traffic, its cost efficiency was comparatively lower.

Based on the analysis, Facebook emerged as the more cost-efficient platform for conversions in this dataset. The findings support a strategic recommendation to allocate a larger portion of the advertising budget toward Facebook campaigns, while further optimizing Google Ads targeting and bidding strategies.
